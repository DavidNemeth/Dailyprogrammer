You have a 30-centimetre ruler. Or is it a 11.8-inch ruler? Or is it even a 9.7-attoparsec ruler?
It means the same thing, of course, but no-one can quite decide which one is the standard.
To help people with this often-frustrating situation you've been tasked with creating a calculator to do the nasty conversion work for you.
Your calculator must be able to convert between metres, inches, miles and attoparsecs.
It must also be able to convert between kilograms, pounds, ounces and hogsheads of Beryllium.
