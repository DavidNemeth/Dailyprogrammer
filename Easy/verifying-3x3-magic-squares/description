//A 3x3 magic square is a 3x3 grid of the numbers 1-9 such that each row, column, and major diagonal adds up to 15. 

//Write a function that, given a grid containing the numbers 1-9,
//determines whether it's a magic square. Use whatever format you want for the grid,
//such as a 2-dimensional array, or a 1-dimensional array of length 9, or a function that takes 9 arguments.
//You do not need to parse the grid from the program's input, but you can if you want to.
//You don't need to check that each of the 9 numbers appears in the grid: assume this to be true.
//A 3x3 magic square is a 3x3 grid of the numbers 1-9 such that each row, column, and major diagonal adds up to 15.
